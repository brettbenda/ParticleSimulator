~~~Order of development~~~
1. Created system that emitted particles from a given point, with a certain gravity
2. Made the system movable by mouse input (i.e. system can be clicked and dragged
3. Refactored existing code
4. Abtracted gravity out into a force (static force in static direction)
5. Added radial force (static force in variable direction [from particle to fixed point])
6. Added "newton" force (variable force based on distance from fixed point, towards the fixed point)
7. Refactored
8. Cleaned up display of existing features
